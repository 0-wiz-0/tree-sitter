Tree-sitter is a library for parsing source code. It aims to be:

* **General** enough to parse any programming language
* **Dependency-free** and written in pure C so that it can be embedded in any application
* **Fast** and incremental so that it can be used in a text editor
* **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
