# Introduction

Tree-sitter is a library for parsing source code. It aims to be:

* **Fast** and incremental so that it can be used in a text editor
* **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
* **General** enough to parse any programming language
* **Dependency-free** (and written in pure C) so that it can be embedded in any application

### Language Bindings

There are currently bindings that allow Tree-sitter to be used from the following languages:

* [JavaScript](https://github.com/tree-sitter/node-tree-sitter)
* [Rust](https://github.com/tree-sitter/rust-tree-sitter)
* [Haskell](https://github.com/tree-sitter/haskell-tree-sitter)
* [Ruby](https://github.com/tree-sitter/ruby-tree-sitter)

### Available Parsers

There are fairly complete parsers for the following languages:

* [Bash](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-bash)
* [C](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c)
* [C++](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-cpp)
* [Go](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-go)
* [JavaScript](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-javascript)
